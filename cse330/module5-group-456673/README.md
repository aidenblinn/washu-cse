### Creative portion  
* I added a tag function that allows users to select one of three event types, which then shows up as a color-coded part of the event entry.  
* I tried to create an event-sharing feature that did not work :(.  
  
### Notes  
I accidentally made my individual repo using my WUSTL key instead of my ID,  
so it should be named module5-individual-apblinn instead of module5-individual-456673 â€“ sorry about that.
